# movie history -- a partial implementation w/grunt/browserify/sass/firebase/promises/handlebars  and some cool stuff to try in your own projects, like using lodash, concatting nested arrays with the spread operator, passing data to Handlebars partials, and using Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener to keep your user logged in.

As always, please inspect, study, and peruse, but don't copy-paste. Thanks.
